# Talecraft Game Engine

> A game engine for playing with block-shaped voxels.

This project is currently at the beginning of it's development.

## Project Goals

> Nothing is truly set in stone except these goals.

Make it as data-driven as possible...

- No hardcoded ID's, wherever possible.
- No hardcoded gameplay elements.
- Make use of emergent systems.
- Make heavy use of CDML.

The final goal (in the far future) is to create the game called Talecraft.
